Dear MS/HS Parents,

Kindly be reminded that we have an early dismissal for our last day of 
school on the 28th.  As previously communicated, we will dismiss all 
students at 12pm this Thursday with lunch being served only to boarding 
students.  The SJA Jeju busses will run as they have on Saturday school 
days.

Finally, please note that the Secondary School Office will be closed 
beginning on Monday, July 2nd, for summer holiday and will remain closed 
by Monday, August 6th.  If you need any official school documents, you 
must let the Secondary School Office know (via email 
secondary@sjajeju.kr only) by this Wednesday 12:00 pm, June 27th.

Best,

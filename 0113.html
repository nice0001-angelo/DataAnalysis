Dear Parents,

The school will be closed for students tomorrow, Friday, August 24, 
2018, so that the school can assess the damage from the typhoon. We 
apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  We plan to open 
our doors for the first day of school on Monday, August 27, 2018.  If 
you have any further questions, please contact the  office: 
elementary@sjajeju.kr | highschool@sjajeju.kr | middleschool@sjajeju.kr

Kind regards,
